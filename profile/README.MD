**is about preserving the qualities that make us uniquely human.**

In a world where AI text generation technology is rampant, we need to build the safeguards so that these technologies are adopted responsibly. This means knowing when and where AI is being applied â€” not to prevent ChatGPT from being used, but to prevent AI from being abused by bad actors (think: bots, misinformation, election interference campaigns, trust and safety violations, differential access to generative AI among low income students, fake news, and articles being misrepresented as human)
